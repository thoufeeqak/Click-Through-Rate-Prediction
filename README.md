# Click-Through-Rate-Prediction
Constructed a logistic regression pipeline to predict click-through rate using data from a recent Kaggle competition. Extracted numerical features from the raw categorical data using one-hot-encoding, reduced the dimensionality of these features via hashing, trained logistic regression models using mllib, tuned hyperparameter via grid search, and interpreted probabilistic predictions via a ROC plot
